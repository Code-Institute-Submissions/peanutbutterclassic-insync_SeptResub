Distinction Performance
At this level, a learner will have achieved all pass and merit criteria, as described above, and will demonstrate characteristics of high-level performance as described below:

Characteristics of performance at DISTINCTION level:

The learner has documented a clear, justified rationale for a real-world application. The development of the project has resulted in a fully-functioning, interactive web application.

The finished project is judged to be publishable in its current form with an evidenced professional-grade user interface and interaction adhering to current practice. There are no logic errors in the code. Where there is a clear breach of accepted design/UX principles or accepted good practice in code organisation, these are fully justified, appropriate and acceptable to the target user. It matches the design and demonstrates the characteristics of craftsmanship in the code. The resulting application is original and not a copy of any walkthrough projects encountered in the unit

Amplification (craftsmanship):

Design

The design of the web application demonstrates the main principles of good UX design:

Information Hierarchy

semantic markup is used to convey structure - all information displayed on the site is presented in an organised fashion, with each piece of information being easy to find
all resources on the site are easy to find, allowing users to navigate the layout of the site intuitively
information is presented and categorised in terms of its priority
User Control

all interaction with the site would be likely to produce a positive emotional response within the user. This is down to the flow of information layout, use of colour, clear and unambiguous navigation structures and all interaction feedback
when displaying media files, the site avoids aggressive automatic pop-ups and autoplay of audio; instead letting the user initiate and control such actions
the user is shown progress indicators where relevant
errors resulting from user actions are reported to the user
Consistency

evident across all pages/sections and covers interactivity as well as design
Confirmation

user actions are confirmed where appropriate, feedback is given at all times
Accessibility

there is evident conformity to accessibility guidelines across all pages/sections and in all interactivity
Any design decisions that contravene accepted user interaction, user experience design principles are identified and described (comments in code or a section in the README)

Development and Implementation

Code demonstrates the characteristics of ‘clean code’:

Consistent and appropriate naming conventions within code and in file naming, e.g.

file names, class name, function names and variable names are descriptive and consistent
for cross-platform compatibility, file and directory names will not have spaces in them and will be lower-case only
all HTML attributes, CSS rules, code variables and function names are consistent in format, follow standards for the language and are appropriate and meaningful
File structure

whenever relevant, files are grouped in directories by file type (e.g. an assets directory will contain all static files, and code may be organised into sub-directories such as css, js, etc.)
there is a clear separation between custom code and any external files (for example, library files are all inside a directory named 'libraries')
files are named consistently and descriptively, without spaces or capitalisation to allow for cross-platform compatibility.
Readability

code is indented in a consistent manner to ease readability, and there are no unnecessary repeated blank lines (and never more than 2)
id/class(CSS and JavaScript)/function/variable names clearly indicate their purpose
all code is split into well-defined and commented sections
semantic markup is used to structure HTML code
HTML, CSS and Javascript are kept in separate, linked files
CSS files are linked to in the HTML file’s head element
non-trivial Javascript code files are linked to at the bottom of the body element (or bottom of the head element if needs loaded before the body HTML)
Defensive design

all input data is validated (e.g. presence check, format check, range check)
Internal errors are handled gracefully, and users are notified of the problem where appropriate.
Comments

all custom code files include clear and relevant comments explaining the purpose of code segments
Compliant code

HTML code passes through the official W3C validator with no issues
CSS code passes through the official (Jigsaw) validator with no issues
JavaScript code passes through a linter (e.g. jshint.com) with no significant issues
Robust code

no logic errors are found when running code
errors caused by user actions are handled
where used, API calls that fail to execute or return data will be handled gracefully, with the site users notified in an obvious way
inputs are validated when necessary.
navigating between pages via the back/forward buttons can never break the site. There are no broken links
user actions do not cause internal errors on the page or in the console
The entire design is implemented, providing an excellent solution to the users' demands

and expectations.

Real-world application

Understandable site-specific content is used rather than Lorem Ipsum placeholder text
All links to external pages open in a separate tab when clicked
The final application is aligned to the critical project needs and user expectations
Version control systems are used effectively.

all code is managed in git with commit messages that reflect the specific reason for the commit
there is a separate, well-defined commit for each individual feature/fix
there are no very large commits which make it harder to understand the development process and could lead the assessor to suspect plagiarism
The entire application development process is documented:

the purpose of the application is clearly described in the README
there is a clear separation between code written by the learner and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). All code from external sources is attributed to its source via comments above the code and (for more extensive dependencies) in the README
the deployment procedure is fully documented in a section in the README file
clear, well-described, explanatory commit messages describe the development process
the README is well-structured and easy to follow
the README file is written in markdown and uses markdown formatting consistently and effectively
The application’s user interface has few errors in spelling and grammar
